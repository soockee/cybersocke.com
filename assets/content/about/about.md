Software Engineer | Monitoring & Observability | Log Analysis | Cloud & Infrastructure Automation

Hey, I'm Simon - a software engineer who enjoys working on security, observability, and infrastructure.
I work in the aviation industry, which involves introducing, integrating, and sometimes customizing security, cloud, and observability solutions.

I love building systems with Go because it is simple and gets the job done.
"And if I can’t explain it simply — in Go — then I don’t understand it well enough."
Therefore, "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

Even though I achieved my educational goal of a master’s degree, I maintain a genuine curiosity and a strong desire for knowledge, which motivates me to stay updated with the latest industry trends and advancements.

I'm also a fan of games and music and appreciate the technical and artistic aspects of their creation.

Feel free to connect if you're interested in discussing cybersecurity, monitoring, observability, cloud infrastructure automation, or other related topics. Cheers!
